            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              According to folk etymology, the name Limbaži originated sometime
              in the 17th century. A recently arrived Swedish minister overheard
              the words "Limba" and "āži" (Latvian for 'male goats').
              Mistakenly, he assumed this was the name of the place, and so the
              town was called "Limbaži". During the Middle Ages, as part of
              Livonia, Limbaži was a fortified town with stone walls, second in
              importance only to Riga.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until the beginning of the 16th century, Lemsahl could be reached
              by seagoing vessels travelling up the Svētupe. Ships came from as
              far as Lübeck and Copenhagen to trade for honey, wax, lumber,
              grain, and furs. The small trading camp surrounding the castle
              grew into a large town, and was admitted to the Hanseatic League.
              Each year, Lemsahl hosted a conference attended by barons from all
              over Livonia, and the city hosted at least three other fairs
              throughout the year as well.

                  The castle is one of the oldest defensive fortifications in
                  Latvia. The castle's gate tower, where fragments of the unique
                  portcullis have survived, offers a view of the reddish roofs
                  of the Old Town of Limbaži. Several important details from the
                  Gothic period have been preserved in the main gate. In the
                  southern building, the Gothic window aisles with flat arches
                  of pointed arches have been preserved. A spring flows from the
                  northern slope of the mound. The surrounding
                  landscape indicates that the castle is one of the oldest
                  protective structures in Latvia.
